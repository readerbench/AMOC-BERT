In October 2007 Radiohead asked their fans to pay as much - or as little - as they liked for a digital download of their new album, In Rainbows.

So what were people willing to pay? The answer is, around GBP2.90.

But only 38% of people who downloaded the album paid anything at all. Two thirds paid only the 45p charge for handling.

The average amount that fans were willing to pay was still only $6 (GBP2.90) - far below the price of a CD or the amount a digital album would cost to download from the Apple iTunes store.

During the first 29 days of October, 1.2 million people worldwide visited Radiohead's In Rainbows website. A large number of these visitors downloaded the album. The study showed that 38% paid to download the album, but that the remaining 62% choose to pay nothing. The percentage of people who downloaded for free in the US (60%) is only very slightly lower than in the rest of the world (64%).

The Radiohead 'honesty box' experiment is being closely watched by other artists, their record labels and management companies. Even though sales of live concert tickets are increasing, CD sales are decreasing. This is because of increased competition and piracy.

Worldwide, people download 20 tracks illegally for every digital download they pay for. So it seems that Radiohead's experiment was successful.
