The two main political parties in Northern Ireland are the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein. The DUP believes strongly that Northern Ireland must remain part of the United Kingdom, while Sinn Fein believes that Northern Ireland should become part of the Republic of Ireland. For many years these two parties have been enemies but this week something extraordinary happened.

The leader of the DUP, Ian Paisley, and the leader of Sinn Fein, Gerry Adams, sat side by side at a meeting for the first time yesterday. At the end of the meeting they announced an agreement to work together from May 8 in a new Northern Ireland government. The two men have been enemies for so long that many people will see this agreement as a very important event in the history of the politics of Northern Ireland. 

The private meeting lasted just over an hour. It was the first time the two parties had ever talked directly to each other. Both parties issued statements promising political cooperation and the start of a new and peaceful era. The governments of the UK and the Irish Republic welcomed the agreement as an important stage in a peace process that has lasted more than 10 years. 

The British government wanted the two parties to agree to work together in the new government before a deadline of midnight yesterday. The DUP did not want to do this. They said they needed more time to be sure that Sinn Fein would support the Northern Ireland police force. The new date of May 8 will give DUP members more time to get used to the new situation. 

The two parties said the atmosphere at their meeting was 'friendly" and 'constructive" but they did not shake hands. 'In the past," Mr Paisley said, 'the British government has set the deadlines but now ... we as a party have agreed when the institutions will start work and how they will work. We have agreed with Sinn Fein that this date will be Tuesday May 8 ... After a long and difficult time in Northern Ireland I believe that the future is optimistic ... We are doing this for all the people of Northern Ireland. The horrors and tragedies of the past must not stop us from creating a better future. But when we look to that future we must never forget those people who have suffered during the dark period which I hope we are now, at last, leaving." 

Mr Adams welcomed the DUP's commitment. 'It is disappointing that we have not restarted all the parliamentary institutions today but I believe the agreement between Sinn Fein and the DUP ... is the beginning of a new era of politics on this island ... Centuries of conflict, hurt and tragedy have damaged the relationships between the people of this island... We have all come a very long way in the process of peace making. We know that many people have suffered. Now we must build the best future possible. It is now time to think of the future of all our people." 

The two parties will go together to the British government to ask for more money for Northern Ireland. Mr Paisley said both parties would work hard before May 8 to make sure everything was ready. The DUP leader left the meeting smiling and shouted to waiting journalists: 'Do you have eyes in your head?" 

In London Tony Blair said: 'Everything that we've done in the last 10 years has been a preparation for this moment. Republicans and nationalists will still be republicans and nationalists, and unionists will still be unionists. But people can now come together, show respect for each other's opinions, share power and express their politics peacefully and democratically."
