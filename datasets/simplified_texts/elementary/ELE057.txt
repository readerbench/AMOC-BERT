On the outside, Tee was a typical student. Living away from home was expensive and he owed money. Like most students, he had a computer and a phone in his room - but instead of using them to study, he turned them into the tools of a 21st century criminal.
 
In his short career as a fraudster, Tee - who is trying to rebuild his life after serving a long prison sentence - estimates that he stole as much as GBP250,000 through stolen credit card details, identity theft and bank account takeover. Police officials last week said the volume of online crime was so high that they could not investigate every case, and that big criminals were moving into the fast-growing field.
 
For Tee, who went to prison for almost four years, the chance to use people's ignorance against them was just too easy. 'Maybe it took an hour a night if I really felt like it. But to me it felt like a bit of fun and a pastime which developed into an easy way of making money." he said.

In spare moments around his university schedule - he was studying law - the young Yorkshireman would get card details taken from insecure websites or passed on from other criminals, and go on spending sprees that got him cars, clothes and cash. Sometimes all he needed was a name and phone number. 'I used to go through different methods depending on how confident I felt," he said. 'I used to call people up and pretend to be from a fraud department and just ask them for their details. But sometimes it's as easy as getting information from a local video shop." Now, 26, Tee admits that by the time he was caught he was thinking of getting bank loans and even mortgages using stolen identities. 

'It was just a game to see how far you could go," he said. 'My favourite trick was to get a card in someone's name and use it. Then, within 24 hours, you call the bank up and convince them that you're the genuine person and that you haven't made those transactions - and they refund it. Then you just go to the cash machine and take it all out again." He even sent flowers to one victim, using their stolen bank details to pay for the bouquet.

Statistics from Cifas, the UK's fraud prevention service, show that identity theft was up almost 20% last year, while Internet and card fraud rose to an all-time high of GBP414m in 2006.

Martin Gill is a criminologist at the University of Leicester. He has studied the actions and motivations of fraudsters and Tee was one of the people he interviewed. Gill believes that fraudsters think that online crime is easy. 'One of the things that comes through is the belief that they're not going to get caught," he said.

'The common reaction among companies selling goods is a real frustration at how hard it is to prosecute and get convictions for people who commit fraud," said Keith Marsden, managing director of 192.com, which sponsors Prove-ID, a private industrial forum on dealing with fraud. Instead, companies are choosing tougher security procedures and programmes to educate the public about safe Internet use.

How to avoid scams 
- Never give personal details over the phone. Banks should never ask for pin numbers or codes. 
- Only shop on secure websites that display a padlock or key symbol in your browser. The address should start https instead of http. 
- Only open email attachments if you are entirely sure it is necessary. 
- Be careful of suspicious-looking emails. Some viruses use the name of somebody you trust as a disguise.
