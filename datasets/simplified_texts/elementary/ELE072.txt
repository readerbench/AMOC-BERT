The A380, built by Airbus in Toulouse, France, will be the biggest airliner in the world. It will carry more than 500 passengers and will travel between the world's largest airports. Last month it took off for its first test flight. The A380 flew for four hours. Afterwards, the pilot said that flying the A380 was as easy as riding a bicycle. Airbus believes that the A380 is the airliner of the future. The A380 will cost $15 billion to produce.

At the moment Airbus is the biggest manufacturer of airliners in the world. This year it plans to sell between 350 and 360 new airliners. It sells more airliners than the American company, Boeing, which will sell about 320 planes this year. Boeing's profits are 14% down on last year. 

Boeing is planning a new airliner too. It is called the 787 Dreamliner and will carry 200 to 250 passengers over very long distances. Airbus believes that the A380 will be more successful because it is bigger than the Dreamliner and it will carry more passengers but Boeing thinks the 787 Dreamliner will be more successful because it will be more flexible and will fly to smaller airports as well as to the largest ones. 

As well as these two new planes, both Airbus and Boeing are marketing new versions of existing products. Airbus is planning a plane called the A350 . which is based on its A330 series and will carry 245-285 people long-haul. This plane will compete with Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. At the same time Boeing is planning a new version of its 40-year-old 747 which will compete with Airbus's A380.

Airbus says that the total market for passenger jets over the next 20 years will be about 16,000. It believes that the market for planes with more than 500 seats will be around 1,400. If Boeing stops production of the 747, which carries about 420 people, the next biggest plane will be the Boeing 777 with only 380 seats. On the other hand, Boeing says the market for planes with more than 500 seats is about 350. It believes the market wants long-range, super-efficient planes flying 200 to 250 people up to 13,000km. It says it will sell about 3,100 787s over the next 20 years. 

Experts do not think Airbus will sell 1,400 A380s, but they say it is possible in theory. Chris Avery, an aviation expert, says: "It is difficult to believe the forecasts but don't forget they are talking about 20 years. It might be possible." He thinks Boeing's forecast is better. 

But Sandy Morris, another aviation expert, says: "Boeing's is a good model in a growing market but how much will it cost? If you look at the A380 you have a plane costing $225m making 1.5 trips a day, carrying, say, 675 people. The 787 costs $150m and carries 375 people. Which one will make a profit first?" The answer is clearly the A380. 

So why is Boeing planning a new version of the 747, carrying up to 450 passengers? Boeing says that, without the 747, there would be nothing in the market between the 777 and the A380. It says it does not want to compete directly with the A380. Airbus does not believe this. An Airbus company official says: "Boeing has been talking about a new version of the 747 for 10 years. This shows that they still believe there is a market for large aircraft." 

The question is which combination will work best. The A380 with more than 500 passengers and the A350, or the 787 Dreamliner and the 747 Advanced? At the moment no-one knows the answer to this question. Airline experts say that we will know the answer in about 15 years time.
