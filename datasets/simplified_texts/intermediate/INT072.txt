The world's largest airliner, the A380, took off from its base in Toulouse recently for a test flight before landing safely four hours later. The pilot said it was as easy as riding a bicycle. The senior management at Airbus said the flight was a triumph of European cooperation. "Airbus has created something that is both marvellous for today and will also be an aerospace icon for decades to come." the company announced in a press release.

At the same time Airbus's arch-rival, Chicago-based Boeing, published its profits for the first quarter of the year. They were down 14% on last year. Boeing used to be the biggest manufacturer of civil aircraft but in the last two years Airbus has sold more planes than Boeing. This year's forecast for Boeing is that it will deliver 320 planes this year compared with 350 to 360 for Airbus. 

So, what do these two events tell us about the future of the aircraft industry? Will Airbus's $15bn giant plane, providing the cheapest flights on the busiest routes, enable Airbus to eclipse Boeing forever? Or might the Europeans be taking an enormous risk? Might Boeing's less eye-catching strategy, using small, hyper-efficient aircraft - such as its 787 Dreamliner, carrying 200-250 people - be the better one? 

In the past year each company has begun to market a variant of one of its existing products to challenge a new model launched by the other. Airbus is planning its A350 . based on its A330 series, carrying 245-285 people long-haul - to challenge Boeing's 787, while Boeing is planning a new ultra-efficient version of its 40-year-old 747. These tactics raise two questions. Are the manufacturers losing confidence in the A380 and the 787? And, as both proposed planes are variants of existing models, are they not simply trying to reduce their competitor's advantage by using so-called 'spoilers'?

Airbus says its figures for the A380 are correct. It says that, out of the total market for about 16,000 passenger jets over the next 20 years, 1,400 will be planes with more than 500 seats. On paper the A380 has no competition in this category and, if Boeing stops production of the 747, which carries about 420 people, the next biggest plane will be the Boeing 777 with only 380 seats. On the other hand, Boeing says the market for planes with more than 500 seats is about 350. It believes demand will be in long-range, super-efficient planes flying 200 to 250 people up to 13,000km. It says it will sell about 3,100 787s over the next 20 years. 

Experts do not think A380 sales will reach 1,400, but they say it is possible in theory. Chris Avery, an aviation analyst, says: "It is hard to believe the forecasts but don't forget they are talking about 20 years. They might do it." He thinks Boeing's forecast is more reasonable. "There are around 2,000 757s and 767s that all need to be replaced over the next 20 years. If you add on growth, a market of 3,000 sounds sensible, and with a new product Boeing should get half of that." 

But Sandy Morris, of ABN Amro, says: "Boeing's is a good model in a situation where the market is growing. But what are the costs going to be? If you look at the A380 you have a plane costing $225m making 1.5 trips a day, carrying, say, 675 people. The 787 costs $150m and carries 375 people. Which one will make a profit first?" The answer is clearly the A380. 

The costs of the Airbus project are going up all the time, however. In December the A380 was $1.9bn over budget, at $16bn. It needs to sell 250 
planes to break even. So far, there are orders for 154. Boeing continues to criticise the A380 and has now taken about 250 orders for the 787. In the past two weeks it has taken orders from Air Canada, Air India and Air Korea. So why is it is 
planning a new version of the 747, carrying up to 450 passengers? 

The company explains that, without the 747, there would be a gap in the market between the 777 and the A380. It insists that the intention is not to compete directly with the A380. It says it is not trying to persuade airlines such as British Airways and Cathay Pacific which are considering the A380 to buy 747s instead. Airbus does not believe this. A company official says: "Boeing has been talking about relaunching its 747 for 10 years. What it shows is they still believe there is a market for large aircraft." 

The question is which package of new plane and spoiler will work best. The A380 is the new icon of the airline industry. The 787 is an attractive prospect for airlines which want flexibility and low costs in a stable market. But the A350 could deliver the same combination, and it is a more modern plane than the 747 Advanced. It will be about 15 years before we know which manufacturer's approach is the more successful.
