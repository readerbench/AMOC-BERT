When Radiohead invited their fans to pay as much - or as little - as they liked for a digital download of their new album, In Rainbows, many said it was the beginning of a new era for the struggling record industry.

So what then, were people willing to pay? Around GBP2.90, it would seem.

Research revealed yesterday that only 38% of people downloading the album were willing to pay anything at all. Two thirds paid only the 45p charge for handling.

The average amount that fans were willing to pay was still only $6 (GBP2.90) - far below the price of a CD or the amount a digital album would cost to download from the Apple iTunes store.

During the first 29 days of October, 1.2 million people worldwide visited Radiohead's In Rainbows website. A large number of these visitors ultimately downloaded the album. The study showed that 38% willingly paid to download the album, with the remaining 62% choosing to pay nothing. The percentage downloading for free in the US (60%) is only very slightly lower than in the rest of the world (64 %).

The Radiohead 'honesty box' experiment has been closely watched by other artists, their record labels and management companies. Despite an increase in sales of live concert tickets, CD sales are less profitable than ever due to increased competition and piracy.

It is thought that worldwide, people download 20 tracks illegally for every digital download they pay for. This suggests that Radiohead's experiment was successful.
