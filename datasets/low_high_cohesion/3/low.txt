      The British lawmaking body was and still is called Parliament. The colonists were not members. The British started passing laws to tax the colonies. Britain thought the colonists should pay their share of the cost of the French and Indian War. The taxes would also help pay for keeping British soldiers in America. The soldiers would serve along the borders of the colonies to protect the settlers from Indian attacks. It seemed fair to the British that the colonists share these costs too. They put taxes on legal papers and everyday items such as glass, paint, and tea.
      The colonists got very upset about these taxes. Their own colonial assemblies had not voted for them. They did not welcome Parliament's tax laws. Their motto became, "No taxation without representation." People would not buy anything British. Colonial assemblies would not collect the taxes. Perhaps the most excitement was caused by groups called the Sons of Liberty. They destroyed tax collectors' homes and drove some tax people out of town.
      Parliament and the king felt that collecting the taxes was too much trouble. In 1770 most of the hated taxes were ended. Things quieted down for a few years.
