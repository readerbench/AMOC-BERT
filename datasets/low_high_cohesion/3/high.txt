      After the French and Indian War, the British lawmaking body, known as the Parliament, passed tax laws because they thought the colonists should share in the cost of the war. So the British raised the money by putting taxes on things that everybody used such as glass, paint, and tea.
      The colonists thought the taxes were very unfair. This is because the British Parliament made the tax laws that the colonists had to follow, but the colonists did not have any say in deciding them. "Having a say" in making the laws means that you decide, by voting, for the people who make the laws. The people who are elected to make the laws are called representatives. The problem was that the colonists were not allowed to vote for the people who made the laws, so they had no representatives in the Parliament.
      When elections were held in Britain, only the people over in Britain voted. The colonists felt that since they could not vote for the people who make the laws, they should not have to follow the laws. So their motto became, "No taxation without representation." That meant they would not pay taxes to a government when they could not vote for representatives to that government.
      The colonists showed their anger about the taxes in several ways. They would not buy anything that came from Britain and so Britain lost money. Some colonists formed groups to protest the taxes in stronger ways. These groups were called the Sons of Liberty. They even destroyed tax collectors' homes and drove some tax people out of town.
      Because of all the trouble the colonists were causing, Britain decided to stop trying to collect most of the taxes. So by 1770 things quieted down for a few years.
