
From time to time the warm current that flows along the coast of Ecuador moves south and pushes the Peru Current away from the coast. This event is called El Nino because it takes place around Christmastime. El Nino means "the child," which is what Spanish-speaking people call the baby Jesus.
      
      When El Nino comes, it brings bad times to Peru's coast.
Heavy rains cause flooding and landslides. Millions of fish die because the warm water has less oxygen and food. When the fish die, thousands of birds starve to death too.
      
      In 1973, Peru's fish catch was about 15 percent of what it had been in 1970. Part of the problem was caused by over-fishing, which had begun to lower the fish supply before 1973. El Nino, however, was the main cause of the problem.
      
      Peru's fishing industry recovered, but it is not likely to ever again reach the high point of 1970. Over-fishing, along with El Nino, nearly destroyed a valuable resource.
