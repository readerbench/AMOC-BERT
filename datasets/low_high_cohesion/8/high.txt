
Every three to five years, the Pacific Ocean's current changes abruptly along the western coastline of South America and causes serious economic hardships for the people of Peru. This sudden change is called El Nino, which means "the Child Jesus," because it occurs immediately after Christmastime.
      
      El Nino is the result of a change in how the ocean and the atmosphere interact with one another. During El Nino, the ocean waters and weather become the opposite of what is considered to be normal. The usually cool Pacific waters are replaced by warmer waters close to the coast. Atmospheric weather changes cause ten times the normal amount of rainfall.
      
      The country of Peru suffers the most from the effects of El Nino. The warmer coastal water from El Nino kills millions of fish like the anchoveta that need cooler water to live. Since birds rely on eating fish to survive, thousands of birds die from starvation. Extreme rainfall from El Nino causes severe flooding and landslides in the rich agricultural regions of northern Peru.
      
      In 1973, effects from El Nino were especially serious because of another problem. Over-fishing had already depleted the once abundant fish supply. During that year, El Nino and over-fishing reduced the fish supply to a very small percentage of its former level.
      
      Peru's fishing industry has not returned to the supply levels that existed before 1973. Since that time, El Nino has continued to affect Peru severely. As a result, Peru's fishing, agricultural, and fertilizer (guano) industries are still in the process of recovery.
