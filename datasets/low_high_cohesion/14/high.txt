To all appearances, Sweeney Todd ran a perfectly respectable business. The grisly secret came out, and Sweeney Todd was hanged. But this time Todd make a mistake. If he discovered the man had no friends in London, Sweeney Todd slit the manís throat. Ingestre had brought back a young boy as his servant. She in turn cut up the bodies and put them into her meat pies.

When such a man came into his shop, Todd would chat to him. He gave the bodies to his next door neighbour, Mrs Lovett the baker. The story of Sweeney Todd has been related so often over the centuries that it is difficult to know how much of it is true. He would then rob the corpse. Ordinary Londoners bought these pies and, unknowingly, were eating human flesh. He not only shaved people, he murdered them as well.

But Sweeney Todd had a dark and terrible secret. Some even claimed that Mrs Lovettís pies were the sweetest and juiciest in London. A lever in the shop tipped the barberís chair backwards, dumping the body in the cellar. Faced with the problem of disposing of the dead bodies, Todd hit upon a terrible, but ingenious idea. For years Sweeney Todd and Mrs Lovett carried on their grisly trade.

One day Todd murdered a young sailor called Mark Ingestre, who had recently returned from abroad. According to the stories, Sweeney Todd was a barber who kept a shop in Fleet Street, London, in the days when the street was little more than a mud track and the houses were built of wood. The boy went to the authorities to report his masterís disappearance and the sailor was traced to Toddís shop. Todd used to prey on sailors and other travellers.
