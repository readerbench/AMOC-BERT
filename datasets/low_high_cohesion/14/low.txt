The story of Sweeney Todd has been related so often over the centuries that it is difficult to know how much of it is true. According to the stories, Sweeney Todd was a barber who kept a shop in Fleet Street, London, in the days when the street was little more than a mud track and the houses were built of wood. To all appearances, Sweeney Tod ran a perfectly respectable business.

But Sweeney Todd had a dark and terrible secret. He not only shaved people, he murdered them as well. Todd used to prey on sailors and other travellers. When such a man came into his shop, Todd would chat to him. If he discovered the man had no friends  in London, Sweeney Todd slit the manís throat. A lever in the shop tipped the barberís chair backwards, dumping the body in the cellar. He would then rob the corpse.

Faced with the problem of disposing of the dead bodies, Todd hit upon a terrible, but ingenious idea. He gave the bodies to his next door neighbour, Mrs Lovett the baker. She in turn cut up the bodies and put them into her meat pies. Ordinary Londoners bought these pies and , unknowingly, were eating human flesh. Some even claimed that Mrs Lovettís pies were the sweetest and juiciest in London.

For years Sweeney Todd and Mrs Lovett carried on their grisly trade. One day Todd murdered a young sailor called Mark Ingestre, who had recently returned from abroad. But this time Todd make a mistake. Ingestre had brought back a young boy as his servant. The boy went to the authorities to report his masterís disappearance and the sailor was traced to Toddís shop. The grisly secret came out, and Sweeney Todd was hanged.
