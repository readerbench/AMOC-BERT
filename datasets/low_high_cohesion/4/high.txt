	About 250 years ago, Britain and France both claimed to own some of the same land, here, in North America. This land was just west of where the 13 colonies were. In 1756, Britain and France went to war to see who would get control of this land. Because the 13 American colonies belonged to Britain, the colonists fought on the same side as Britain. Many Indians fought on the same side as France. Because we were fighting against the French and Indians, the war has come to be known as the French and Indian War.
	The war ended in 1763. Britain won the war. Now Britain had control of North America, including Canada. The French had to leave North America.
	The colonists were very glad that Britain had won. They now felt safer in their homes. Before the war, Indians had often attacked colonists who lived near the borders. Now Britain owned these lands where the Indians lived. The colonists were sure that Britain would protect them.	.
      The colonists were happy to be a part of Britain, but that was about to change. They began to decide that they would rather have their own country, ... independent from Britain. So a dozen years later, the colonists would be fighting the British for freedom from Great Britain's rule. This later war would be called the War for Independence, or the American Revolution.
