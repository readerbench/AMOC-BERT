      The British were very angry!' Within a few months, they- passed what the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. Intolerable means "unbearable". These acts were meant to punish the people of Boston. The port of Boston was closed. No self-government was allowed in Massachusetts. British troops had to be housed and fed by the Massachusetts colonists.
      Colonial leaders in Boston acted quickly. Letters were sent telling people in the other colonies what was happening in Boston. The other colonies sent help and supplies. People wondered if their colony would be the next to feel the anger of Great Britain.
