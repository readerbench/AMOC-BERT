	The British were very angry about the ìTea Partyî! They passed some new laws to punish the people of Boston. The colonists thought these laws were so cruel that they called them the Intolerable Acts. When something is intolerable it means ìyou just can't stand it!!î
      These laws did many things that made life in Boston very difficult. For example, the British closed the port of Boston. That meant no ships could get in or out. Since most of Boston' supplies came in by ship, food and other important things soon became very hard to get.
      Another thing the British did was to stop self-government in Massachusetts. This meant they no longer allowed the colonists to make any decisions about how their colony was run. The colonists used to be able to make some decisions on their own, but now Britain took those rights away. The British also sent a lot of their soldiers to Massachusetts to control the colonists. And the British made the colonists provide housing and food for these soldiers. This was very hard, because with the port of Boston closed, food and supplies were hard to get.
      Colonial leaders in Boston quickly sent letters to the people in the other colonies to tell them what was happening in Boston. When the other colonies learned of Boston's troubles, they sent help and supplies. It frightened people ir other colonies that Britain could act so harshly. People feared that their colony might be the next to feel the anger of Great Britain.
