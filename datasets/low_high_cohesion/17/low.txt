In the autumn of 1557, Martin Guerre came home to the French village of Artigat after eight years away at the wars. His wife  and his sister were delighted to see him. Within a few days Martin Guerre had settled back into his old life.

The months went by, and Martin Guerre prospered. His land yielded him high rents and, in time, his wife bore him a daughter. Martin Guerre seemed to be leading a perfect life, except for one problem. The wars had changed him. He seemed untrustworthy, especially where money was concerned. Martinís uncle, Pierre Guerre, thought something was wrong.

Some years later, Pierreís suspicions were justified. A man with a wooden leg came stomping up the road up to Martin Guerreís house. He hammered on the door, demanding to be let in. A maid, who answered the door, stared at the man and then screamed in horror. Guerreís wife, running forwards, took one look at the man and fainted. The stranger was the image of Martin Guerre. Not only were the two menís faces identical, but they both had the same twisted fingernail, the same four warts on the right hand and the same scar on the forehead. They were mirror images of each other.

The truth was that, during a battle in Flanders, Martin Guerre had lost his leg and been left for dead. Another man in the same regiment, Arnauld the Tilly, looked so much like Martin Guerre that he decided to take the dead manís place. It was Tilly who had walked into Artigat in 1557 and who had taken over the home of Martin Guerre. The real Martin Guerre, meanwhile, had gradually recovered from his wounds, but lost his memory. It was only when he remembered who he was that he returned home.
