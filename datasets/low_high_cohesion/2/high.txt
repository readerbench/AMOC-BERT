	The reason the British kept the tax on tea was that they wanted to prove that they had the right to tax the colonies. Britain believed they had that right because the colonies belonged to Britain. Even though the tax on tea was very small, the colonists feelings about Britain's taxes had not changed. They would not pay any tax passed by Parliament. To show their feelings, the colonists refused to buy any tea. So British merchants were losing money because they weren't able to sell their tea.
     	To help their merchants sell tea, the British greatly lowered its price. Now the price of tea was less than it had ever been, but it still included the tax. Since it was now cheaper than ever, the British thought that surely the colonists would buy tea! So they sent boatloads of tea to the colonies. But, because the tea still had the tax on it, the colonists were as angry as ever.
      To show their anger, the colonists burned some of the tea. They left some to rot. Sometimes they would not allow ships loaded with it into their ports. In Boston, the Sons of Liberty snuck into Boston Harbor late one night and threw more than 300 chests of tea into the water! The colonists called this the Boston Tea Party.
