      George III, the king of England, said that there had to be a tax on something to prove that the British had the right to tax. So there was still a small tax on tea. The colonists remained firm. They would not pay any tax passed by Parliament. Colonial women refused to buy or serve tea.
      British merchants were not selling much tea. So Parliament passed a law that greatly lowered its price. Boatloads of tea were sent to America. Since it was cheaper than ever, the British thought that surely the colonists would buy tea now!
      They were wrong. Tea was burned. Tea was left to rot. Ships loaded with it were not allowed in ports. In Boston the Sons of Liberty dressed up as Indians. Late at night they went to Boston Harbor and threw more than 300 chests of tea into the water. This action was called the Boston Tea Party.
